# num_pages represents the number of pages to display in the output.  To specify
# that all pages should be displayed in the output, use a value less than or
# equal to 0.  filtlog will only display the top N results (by number of page
# views), including their associated referers, where N is the value of
# num_pages.
num_pages = 0

# num_referers represents the number of referers per page to display in the
# output.  To specify that all referers should be displayed in the output, use a
# value less than or equal to 0.  filtlog will only display the top M referers
# (by number of referrals for a given page) for each page, where M is the value
# of num_referers.
num_referers = 0

# bot_ids is a list of user agent substrings for user agents that should be
# ignored in the results, such as search engine bots.  If the substring matches
# any part of a given user agent, accesses from that user agent will not appear
# in the results.  For example, "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1;
# +http://www.google.com/bot.html)" will be matched by one of the substrings
# listed below: 'http://www.google.com/bot.html'.  Feel free to submit updates
# to this list to the filtlog maintainer (see the README file).
#
# To determine which user agents might be bots, run user_agents.rb on your log
# files.  This will show you the user agents that most often access your web
# site.  Adding high-ranking bots from there to this list will improve the
# accuracy of filtlog's results by increasing the percentage of hits initiated
# by real people that appear in the results.
