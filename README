1. Running filtlog
------------------

filtlog requires Ruby to run.  If you don't have Ruby, you can download it from
http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ or, if you're using Ubuntu, you can run
"sudo apt-get install ruby".

To run filtlog with the default options, simply pass the web server log file(s)
you want to summarize to filtlog.rb (ie. "./filtlog.rb access.log").  The log
files are assumed to be in Apache Combined Log Format.  The output will look
something like this:

874     /?p=172 Vimeo Downloader 0.1 released
    230     -
    75      http://ossguy.com/?p=172
    13      http://www.google.com/search?q=vimeo+downloader&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
    6       http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=vimeo+downloader&aq=f&oq=

846     /
    616     -
    21      http://ossguy.com/?p=266
    14      http://ossguy.com/?p=226
    12      http://www.followsite.com/bot.html
    12      http://www.gnu.org/people/
    11      http://ossguy.com/
...

The first line is the page with the most hits (/?p=172) preceded by the number
of hits it received (874).  The lines that follow are the referrers used to find
that page, preceded by the number of times the referrer was used.  For more
information on HTTP referrers, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referrer.

In order to get page descriptions, like "Vimeo Downloader 0.1 released" above,
you need to add the corresponding information to page_names in filtlog.conf.
For more details, see the inline comments in filtlog.conf.example.


2. Example log files
--------------------

If you want to see how filtlog works but don't have any log files to test it
with, you can find log files online.  Here are some log files found through a
Google search for 'get googlebot "yahoo slurp"':

3. Configuring filtlog
----------------------

filtlog expects its configuration file to be located in filtlog.conf.  An
example configuration file is included as filtlog.conf.example.  You can copy
that file to filtlog.conf and modify it to suit your needs.  Full details on the
various configuration file options, including how to use user_agents.rb to help
filter results, are provided inline in filtlog.conf.example.


4. Performance
--------------

filtlog can take a while to run on a large set of log files.  As an example,
running filtlog on 28 log files containing a total of 103,143 lines takes
8.6 seconds to run using Ruby 1.8 on a 1.3 GHz Pentium M running Ubuntu 8.10 and
7.9 seconds using Ruby 1.9 on the same machine.

Since filtlog does not make significant use of Ruby's dynamic language features,
it should be easy to convert filtlog directly to C or some other static
language whose compiler could offer better performance.  ruby2c
(http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby2c/) may be able to convert it automatically,
though this has not yet been tried.
